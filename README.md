# GMX-Installation with mini-conda using WSL2

The objective is to harness the power of your GPU for molecular dynamics mining, enhancing computational efficiency and accelerating simulations.

## Description

Install GROMACS in MiniConda by creating a dedicated environment, ensuring compatibility and leveraging informatics skills for molecular dynamic simulations.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* WSL updated to version 2.0 - WSL version 1.0 will not let you use your GPU
* You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11
* GROMACS version : 2023.3-conda_forge
* Windows 10

* 1. Install WSL

Personal approach:

To install WSL and its components, I enabled the "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Subsystem for Linux" in the Windows Features window. You can access this by executing "optionalfeatures" with the "run" feature WIN+R

Install all necessary components for WSL using a single command. To do this, open **PowerShell** or Windows Command Prompt as an **administrator**, right-click, choose **"Run as administrator,"** enter the command "wsl --install," and restart your machine.

* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program
